# LJ Code 201 - Day 17

As usual, we started class off with a code review. The code review was a bit extended today and went over the table, form etc for Lab 8 and 9. The code review was reinforced through the code demo which went into more detail about Lab 9.

We finished the class off with wireframing and CSS. It was a good end to the lecture, as far as I was concerned considering I enjoy the wireframing and CSS aspect of things. I just got to get the DOM manipulation down better and being enjoyable as CSS. Overall good night and lecture.
