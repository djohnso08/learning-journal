# LJ Code 201 - Day 22

 We did a code review and touched on using the debugger. Also, we discussed the upcoming lab of Bus Mall and implementing charts. Project week is coming up real quick and today a few ideas were presented. The class has some great ideas overall. Outside of that, bus mall here we come!
