# LJ Code 201 - Day 20

 The code review was extended again which is always a great learning experience. The code review consisted of Salmon Cookies assignment in its entirety. The lecture consisted of a code demonstration about CSS and wireframing. The code demonstration was a good preparation for Chocolate Pizza.
