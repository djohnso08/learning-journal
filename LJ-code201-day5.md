# LJ Code 201 - Day 5

We learned about loops, arrays, box model, etc. I feel alot more comfortable with the concepts now. Although, CSS is still a skill to be mastered. At the moment, I am spending more time trying to master CSS and getting the page to look the way I want it. JavaScript does take up a considerable amount of time, but not as much as CSS. I'm sure this will change soon enough.

Overall I'm staying ahead and feel like I'm progessing at a good pace.
