# LJ Code 301 - Day 13

Today is the second week of paired programming and it provides a great way to not only get to know your team, but also see the different styles of learning. Whiteboarding the code wars challenges with your partner is also a great addition to the curriculum.

We have learned about Jquery, SMACSS, live-server, responsive web design etc. The class has definitely challenged me in different ways.
