# LJ Code 201 - Day 26

Today consisted of picking what project we wanted to work on. I decided to choose the project that would challenge me the most and give me the opportunity to potentially work on it further as we progress through 301 and 401. I'm looking forward to working with this group and seeing what we can build together.

We had another great code demonstation about the graph and local storage. Rachel seems to always give you enough to solve it, but not too much where you wont feel the burn. I do appreciate that, but of course that appreciation usually happens after I solve the problem. Thats always as expected though I'm sure. We are here to learn and I feel like I've learned significant amount in these few weeks.

Project week is right around the corner so look out here we come!
