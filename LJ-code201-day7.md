# LJ Code 201 - Day 7

Today we started off with a modified code review which is always a learning experience when going over any type of code.

We learned about git branching, images, color, text and functions. I believe the review from the book and using the coding examples from the book and actually writing the code during the lecture helped solidify a lot of the concepts. Also, have the class partticpate in style the different elements in the code was very useful.

I think today was a great learning experience and helped strengthen some of the topics we may have not felt as strong about before today.
