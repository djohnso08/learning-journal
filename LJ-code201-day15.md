# LJ Code 201 - Day 15

The class started with a review of the feedback survey and then a review of Anna's code. Code reviews are always great for me. I always learn something new and different especially when it's some one else's code. We also reviewed the instructors code for Salmon cookies and everyone participated in breaking down the code which was interesting and extremly informative. Every one has their own respective way of explaining what the code is doing and/or saying and everyone's idea continue to educate me and expand my thoughts on things.

The lecture came after the Salmon cookies table and the lecture included some more code review which should help on the upcoming lab. 

This is the point where my brain is feeling the burn, but luckily it's a good burn. At least, thats what I've been told. I still feel pretty confident about my position within the class. I don't quite understand everything, but I'm sure it will all click soon.
