# LJ Code 201 - Day 3

The class started off with a code review of my code and it went very well. I enjoyed the code review and being able to articulate what was happening with my code. We were asked to explain git and github to the classmate next to us for one minute. I learned that I need to work on my explanation about concepts and being more confident in the delivery of it.

Once code review was over we went over details of future work such as, learning journals, projects, assignments etc.

I learned about Git, Github, markdown, A.C.P, and a slew of other concepts.

I got the chance to help and enourage others in class which is what I enjoyed most. Hopefully, I can give back more eventually and be in a position to TA. I plan on trying to stay ahead and continously expanding in my spare time so I can continue to be a asset to the class and of course myself.
