# LJ Code 201 - Day 24

 We started the class off with another awesome code demonstration to help with solving Bus Mall. It was more of an example/demonstration of how to solve the problem than actually solving it in its entirety. The example still helped out a lot and showed me other ways to go about solving it.

 Next, we briefly reviewed a classmates code, but his problem was solved right before class so I should just say job well done. After reviewing the code we dove into more code demonstration, but this time it involved Chartjs. At this point it seemed like an simple task, but low and behold I'm sure it is nothing close to that.

 We finish the class with some ideas for projects and there were some great ideas. I'm not that great with ideas, but definitely play a more of a supportive role when it comes to things. I think a lot of others had ideas, but maybe didn't want to present them in front of the class. Public speaking is always nerve wrecking, but I do hope that we get to hear some of the other creative ideas although the ones that were presented were pretty extraordinary.

 As always class was fun, educational and I never have any fall asleep moments in that class
