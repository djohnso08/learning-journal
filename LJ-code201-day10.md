Today we learned about the DOM and were able to go in depth about it. The code review and lecture were spot on today and reinforced the information. I think overall today's lecture and code review helped prepare us for whats to come.

I always come from the lectures feeling liike I fully understand the material. In short our instructor Rachel is amazing.
